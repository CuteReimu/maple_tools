## Regular Potential

The potential system is a bonus to item stats previously set. If you pick up an item, there might be a notice in your
chat window saying, "You get the Rare/Epic/Unique/Legendary Item.", depending on rank. That item will have a coloured
border around it based on the potential or bonus potential rank. The colour corresponding to the rank is based on the
higher rank out of normal potential and bonus potential but if either of them is unrevealed, the border will be red.

- If the item has a red outline, it means it has hidden potential or hidden bonus potential. Mouse over the item to view
  the regular potential rank, bonus potential rank will remain hidden.
- If the item has a blue outline, it's a rare item with both revealed potentials exist at rare rank or below.
- If the item has a purple outline, it's an epic item with both revealed potentials exist at epic rank or below.
- If the item has a yellow outline, it's an unique item with both revealed potentials exist at unique rank or below.
- If the item has a green outline, it's a legendary item with both revealed potentials exist at legendary rank or below.

### Tiers

There are 4 tiers of normal potential items and weapon/secondary weapon/emblem's bonus potentials:

- Level 0~30 items can get: 1% on rare, 2% on epic, 3% on unique, 6% on legendary
- Level 31~70 items can get: 2% on rare, 4% on epic, 6% on unique, 9% on legendary
- Level 71~200 items (level 71~150 items for GMS and TMS) can get: 3% on rare, 6% on epic, 9% on unique, 12% on
  legendary
- Level 201+ items (level 151+ items for GMS and TMS) can 4% on rare, 7% on epic, 10% on unique, 13% on legendary
    - All stat % are 1 rank below the stated rank.

  :::

## Increasing Potential Lines

Items with potential will have either 2 or 3 lines of stat bonuses. Normally, when a potential scroll is used on an item
without potential, there is a **75% chance of it being 2 lines** and a **25% chance of it being 3 lines**. If a higher
graded potential scroll is used on an item with potential, the **number of lines will be inherited**.

You can increase the number of lines from 2 to 3 using the following items:

- Carved Silver Stamp (50% pass, potentials are not reset)
- Carved Golden Stamp (80% pass, potentials are not reset)
- Perfect Carved Stamp (100% pass, potentials are not reset, untradable)

You can obtain Carved Silver Stamps and Carved Golden Stamps from the following methods (tradable and does not expire
unless specified):

**Carved Silver Stamps**

- Hard Ranmaru drops at a low chance
- Elite monsters/champions drop at a really low chance
- Bounty Portal Pouches (low chance from Basic and Intermediate pouches, untradable, expires in 7 days)
- Monster Collection (low chance to obtain from 3/6/24 hour explorations, untradable, expires in 7 days)
- (Reboot World Only) Elite Boss

## Reset Potentials

You can reset potentials using the following items (Item rank can increase at a small chance, it will never decrease
unless Selection cube is used):

- Red Cube (cost 1,200 NX cash (2,100 cash in MSEA), usable from Rare to Legendary)
- Black Cube (cost 2,200 NX cash (3,500 cash in MSEA), usable from Rare to Legendary, choose between before or after
  reset)
- Selection Cube (**Event Sales**, Usable on weapons only, from Rare to Legendary, potentials chosen are from a fixed
  pool that reshuffles every 20 minutes, **rank can decrease**)
- Violet Cube/Hexa Cube (**Event Sales**, Cost 4,000 NX cash (6,000 cash in MSEA), sold only during certain events,
  usable from Rare to Legendary, choose 2 lines from 4 lines for 2 lined items, choose 3 lines from 6 lines for 3 lined
  items)
- Equality Cube (**Event Sales**, costs more than Hexa cube, usable from Rare to Epic, all 3 lines will be prime)
- Occult Cube/Suspicious Cube (Usable from Rare to Epic, can be obtained through game methods)
- Master Craftsman's Cube/Yellow Cube (Usable from Rare to Unique, can be obtained through game methods)
- Meister's Cube/Purple Cube (Usable from Rare to Legendary, can be obtained through game methods)

**Karma type cubes can only be used on untradable items, Event Ring Exclusive Purple Cubes can only be used on event
rings, and the performance follows that of the normal type cube**.

For Zero weapons, using 600 Weapon Points + 100,000 mesos to reset is also possible. **This will work exactly the same
way as a Yellow/Master Craftsman Cube**.

For Chaos Ring from event shops, the reset is possible 10 times per week (resets on Monday 12am server time) for 180
days from the time the ring is obtained after exchanging from the coupon. The reset will also reset base stats. **It can
only reset up to Unique rank potentials and it can rank up to Unique if it is not at Unique.** When resetting the base
stats with legendary potentials, the potential is not reset.

During Miracle Time events, **the chance of increasing the potential rank from any method is doubled**. During Double
Miracle Time events, **the chance of increasing the potential rank is doubled and also allows a very small chance of a
double rank-up in a single reset**.

In general, outside the miracle time and double miracle time event, the chance of the rank to increase is estimated as
below. May be inaccurate. **Zero weapons reset using the Weapon Point system follows the Master Craftsman/Yellow cube
probabilities**.

For GMS, the rates are noted to be wildly higher than stated, and for MSEA, it is assumed to be the same as KMS but no
official rates are stated.

**GMS**

| Cube	                   | Rare -> Epic | 	Epic -> Unique | 	Unique -> Legendary |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Occult/Suspicious       | 	1%	         | N/A             | 	N/A                 |
| Master Craftsman/Yellow | 	11.8%	      | 3.8%	           | N/A                  |
| Meister/Purple, RED     | 	14.1%	      | 6%              | 	2.4%                |
| Black                   | 	16%         | 	11%            | 	4.7%                |

**KMS**

| Cube	                   | Rare -> Epic            | 	Epic -> Unique	        | Unique -> Legendary |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Occult/Suspicious       | 	0.99% (1 in 101)       | 	N/A                    | 	N/A                |
| Master Craftsman/Yellow | 	4.7619% (1 in 21)      | 	1.1857% (1 in 84.9666) | 	N/A                |
| Meister/Purple          | 	7.9994% (1 in 12.5008) | 	1.6958% (1 in 58.9666) | 	0.1996% (1 in 501) |
| RED	                    | 6%	                     | 1.8%	                   | 0.3%                |
| Black	                  | 15%	                    | 3.5%	                   | 1.2%                |

There is also a small chance for the 2nd and 3rd line to give the maximum value (also known as prime), 1st line will
always give the maximum value, unless the Hexa/Violet cube is used. **Equality cubes ensure that it is 100% chance of
prime lines**. For the other cash cubes, the chance of the rank is dependent on the cube and the line's position,
meaning that if the 2nd line is not a prime line, the chance of the 3rd line being a prime line still remains the same.

For in game cubes, the rates are set based on the cube and rank, and the 2nd and 3rd line have the same chance, even
though they are determined separately.

| Cube                    | 	Chance at Rare       | 	Chance at Epic         | 	Chance at Unique       | 	Chance at Legendary |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Suspicious              | 	0.0999% (1 in 1,001) | 	0.99% (1 in 101)       |                         |                      |
| Master Craftsman/Yellow | 	16.6666% (1 in 6)	   | 4.7619% (1 in 21)	      | 1.1857% (1 in 84.3333)  |                      |
| Meister/Purple          | 	16.6666% (1 in 6)    | 	7.9994% (1 in 12.5008) | 	1.6958% (1 in 58.9666) | 	0.1996% (1 in 501)  |

For cash cubes, the rates are set based on the cube itself rather than the rank, and the 2nd and 3rd line have separate
chances.

| Cube	      | 2nd line chance | 3rd line chance |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| RED cube   | 10%             | 1%              |
| Black cube | 20%             | 5%              |

For Hexa/Violet cubes, the prime line chances are as below.

| Line | Prime line chance |
|------|-------------------|
| 1st  | 100%              |
| 2nd  | 10% (20% in TMS)  |
| 3rd  | 1% (15% in TMS)   |
| 4th  | 1% (100% in TMS)  |
| 5th  | 10% (20% in TMS)  |
| 6th  | 1% (15% in TMS)   |

The prime line rates are compared below, based on Legendary.

| Cube                    | 	Double Prime or better | 	Triple Prime or better  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Meister/Purple Cube** | 	0.3988%	               | 0.000398% (1 in 251,001) |
| **RED Cube**	           | 10.9%                   | 	0.1%                    |
| **Black Cube**	         | 24%	                    | 1%                       |
| **Hexa Cube**	          | 21.4057% (100% in TMS)	 | 1.5587% (53.76% in TMS)  |
| **Equality Cube**	      | 100%	                   | 100%                     |
